# hello-world
This is a little demo so I can get used to this 


I'm just going to write some random text in here so I have something to work with.
This is a second line of this page and I think it's better than the first line.

Now the goal is to add a third line and see if I can make sense out of this layout. I am really bad at using VI. 

The end goal herer is to use git push to throw the file back to the master repo I guess... well actually have it's own branch
